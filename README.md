# HW5.dailyCalender

For this homework assignment we were given an html and css file.  Our goal was to create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day (9AM-5PM).  We also were told to use Moment.js.

## Acceptable Criteria
```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```

## What I accomplished

I was able to accomplish all the above acceptable criteria.  Below is an exemple of the application and how certain parts work:
